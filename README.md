## Installation / Usage
* If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have python3 globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get python3 [here](https://www.python.org).
* After this, ensure you have installed virtualenv globally as well. If not, run this:
    ```
        $ pip install virtualenv
    ```
* Git clone this repo to your PC
    ```
        $ git clone git@https://github.com/hadijahkyampeire/newyummy_api
    ```


* #### Dependencies
    1. Cd into your the cloned repo as such:
        ```
        $ cd newyummy_api
        ```

    2. Create and fire up your virtual environment in python3:
        ```
        $ virtualenv -p python3 venv

        $ pip install autoenv
        ```
        Activate the virtual environment
        ```sh
        $ source env/bin/activate
        ```

* #### Environment Variables
    Create a .env file and add the following:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    export SECRET="some-very-long-string-of-random-characters-CHANGE-TO-YOUR-LIKING"
    export APP_SETTINGS="development"
    export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/flask_api"
    ```

    Save the file. CD out of the directory and back in. `Autoenv` will automatically set the variables.
    We've now kept sensitive info from the outside world! ðŸ˜„

* #### Install your requirements
    ```
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

* #### Migrations
    On your psql console, create your database:
    ```
    > CREATE DATABASE flask_api;
    ```
    Then, make and apply your Migrations
    ```
    (venv)$ python manage.py db init

    (venv)$ python manage.py db migrate
    ```

    And finally, migrate your migrations to persist on the DB
    ```
    (venv)$ python manage.py db upgrade
    ```
## Database URI
    $ export DB_URL='postgresql://dbusername:dbpassword@localhost/dbname'
    ```
    Start the application by running
    ```sh
    $ python run.py
